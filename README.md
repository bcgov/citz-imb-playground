# IMB Playground: TypeRacer - Real-time Multiplayer Typing Competition

Please note this repository is created to conduct PoC and experiment on new features/technologies. 

This is a TypeScript-based **monorepo** web application where users can host and join typing competitions to compete on speed and accuracy. Built with modern BC Government standards using the BC Design System for consistent user experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This TypeRacer application follows a **modern full-stack layered monolith architecture** with real-time communication:

### Architecture Layers
1. **Presentation Layer** (React + TypeScript)
   - Component-based UI with React hooks
   - Real-time state management for game interactions
   - Responsive design with styled components

2. **API Layer** (Express.js REST + Socket.IO)
   - RESTful endpoints for game creation and file uploads
   - WebSocket connections for real-time multiplayer features
   - CORS-enabled cross-origin communication

3. **Business Logic Layer** (Services + Socket Handlers)
   - Game state management service
   - Socket event handlers for real-time communication
   - File processing and validation logic

4. **Data Layer** (In-memory storage)
   - Runtime game state management
   - File system storage for uploaded content
   - No persistent database (stateless design)

### Secondary Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React functional components with hooks
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Socket.IO for real-time event handling
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of routes, services, and components
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Traditional separation with real-time enhancements

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Docker (optional, for Sentry monitoring)

### Installation & Startup

```bash
# Install all dependencies for monorepo (root, frontend, backend, shared)
npm install

# Start both servers with hot reload using Turborepo (recommended)
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001

### Individual Package Commands

```bash
# Run specific package commands using Turborepo filters
npm run dev:frontend                        # Frontend only (localhost:3000)
npm run dev:backend                         # Backend only (localhost:3001)

# Alternative workspace commands
npm run dev --workspace=packages/backend    # Backend only
npm run dev --workspace=packages/frontend   # Frontend only

# Production builds using Turborepo
npm run build                               # Build all packages
npm run build:frontend                      # Build frontend only
npm run build:backend                       # Build backend only
```

## üî• Hot Reload

Both frontend and backend support hot reload for rapid development:

- **Backend Hot Reload**: `nodemon` watches TypeScript files and auto-restarts server
- **Frontend Hot Reload**: React's built-in HMR updates components without page refresh
- **Shared Types**: Changes in `shared/types.ts` trigger rebuilds in both frontend and backend

## ‚ú® Features

### Setup
See [SENTRY_SETUP.md](./SENTRY_SETUP.md) for detailed Sentry configuration instructions.

Quick setup:
```bash
# Start self-hosted Sentry
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sentry.yml up -d

# Configure environment variables (see SENTRY_SETUP.md)
copy packages\backend\.env.example packages\backend\.env      # Windows
copy packages\frontend\.env.example packages\frontend\.env    # Windows

# Or on Linux/Mac:
# cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
# cp packages/frontend/.env.example packages/frontend/.env

# Update DSN values in .env files
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Comparison

| Architecture Style | TypeRacer Implementation | Advantages | Trade-offs |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------|------------|
| **Layered Monolith** | ‚úÖ Current approach | Clear separation, single deployment, maintainable | Can become rigid, scaling limitations |
| **Microservices** | ‚ùå Single backend service | Better scalability, technology diversity | More complex deployment, network overhead |
| **Modular Monolith** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially (component modules) | Better organization than monolith | Still single deployment unit |
| **Event-Driven** | ‚úÖ Socket.IO events | Loose coupling, real-time responsiveness | Event complexity, debugging challenges |
| **Pipeline** | ‚ùå Not batch processing | Great for data transformation | Not suitable for real-time interaction |

**Why Layered Monolith Works Well:**
- **Real-time Requirements**: Socket.IO perfect for multiplayer typing races
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types ensure consistency across layers
- **Development Speed**: Hot reload on both frontend and backend

## üèóÔ∏è Monorepo vs Conventional Structure

### Current Monorepo Architecture (Turborepo)

This project uses a **monorepo structure** managed by Turborepo for efficient development and deployment:

```
typeracer-monorepo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/           # React TypeScript app
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/            # Node.js Express API
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/             # Shared TypeScript types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ turbo.json              # Turborepo configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            # Root workspace configuration
```

### Monorepo Benefits ‚úÖ

| Aspect | Monorepo Advantage | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Type Safety** | Shared types across frontend/backend | Eliminates API contract mismatches |
| **Development** | Single `npm run dev` starts everything | Faster iteration cycles |
| **Code Sharing** | Reusable utilities and types | Reduced duplication |
| **Versioning** | Synchronized releases | No version compatibility issues |
| **Refactoring** | Cross-package changes in single PR | Easier large-scale changes |
| **Dependencies** | Centralized dependency management | Consistent versions across packages |

### Conventional Structure Comparison

**Conventional Separate Repositories:**
```
typeracer-frontend/         # Separate repo
typeracer-backend/          # Separate repo  
typeracer-shared/           # Separate npm package
```

### Trade-offs Analysis

| Factor | Monorepo | Conventional Repos |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Medium (Turborepo config) | Low (standard npm) |
| **CI/CD** | Complex (affected packages) | Simple (per repo) |
| **Team Coordination** | Easier (single repo) | Harder (multiple repos) |
| **Deployment** | Coordinated releases | Independent releases |
| **Repository Size** | Larger (all code) | Smaller (focused) |
| **Build Performance** | Optimized (Turborepo cache) | Standard |

### Why Monorepo Works for TypeRacer

1. **Real-time Coordination**: Frontend/backend must stay synchronized for Socket.IO events
2. **Shared Game Logic**: Game state interfaces used by both client and server
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick feature development across full stack
4. **Type Safety**: Immediate feedback when API contracts change
5. **Single Deployment**: Simplified hosting and environment management

**Recommendation**: Monorepo is ideal for tightly coupled applications like real-time games where frontend and backend evolve together.
